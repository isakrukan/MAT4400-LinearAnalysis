\begin{definition}[Borel]
    The \(\sigma\)-algebra \(\sigma(\mathcal{O})\) generated by the open sets \(\mathcal{O} = \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{R}^n}\) of $\mathbb{R}^n$
    is called \textbf{Borel $\sigma$-algebra}, and its members are called \textbf{Borel sets} or
    \textbf{Borel measurable sets}.
