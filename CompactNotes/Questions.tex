\begin{itemize}
    \item In problem 26.18 we are supposed to show that \(Y_n\bot Y_m = 0\), i.e. that \(\langle y_n, y_m\rangle =0\), \(n\neq m\).
    I get ... 
    \begin{align*}
        \langle y_n,y_\rangle \subset\int_{A^{c}_{m}}\vert y_n \vert^2 \vert y_m\vert^2d\mu,
    \end{align*}
    and I want to argue that this is zero since \(\int_{A^{c}_{m}}\vert y_m\vert^2d\mu = 0\), but I don't see how. The solutions are not clear, and I think
    perhaps my setup is wrong. I am assuming \(\langle f,g\rangle = \int_X f\bar{g}d\mu\), i.e. from \(L^2\), but perhaps it is rather 
    \(\langle f,g\rangle = \int_{A^{c}_{m}\cup A^{c}_{n}} f\bar{g}d\mu\) or something?
